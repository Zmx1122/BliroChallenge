The board meeting, led by Linda, covered financials showing a 7% Q2 earnings increase and rising operational costs from new software. A proposal to reallocate funds to digital marketing was discussed. A financial strategy session is set for next week. Issues with software implementation were attributed to the lack of training and system integration flaws. A task force was formed to assess solutions. The meeting emphasized an integrated marketing approach and addressing regulatory challenges for expansion. Action items include tackling software issues, drafting an integrated marketing strategy, and coordinating with the legal team on expansion challenges. The team will reconvene next week for updates.
